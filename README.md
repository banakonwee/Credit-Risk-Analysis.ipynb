# Credit Risk Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Credit-Risk-Analysis.ipynb`) that performs credit risk analysis using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the credit risk of loan applicants. By analyzing various features of the applicants, the model aims to predict whether an applicant is likely to default on their loan.

## Files

* `Credit-Risk-Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* (Optional) `data/`: A directory containing the dataset used for the analysis. (If you have a data folder)
* (Optional) `requirements.txt`: A file listing the Python libraries required to run the notebook. (If you have a requirements file)

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_name]
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Install dependencies:**

    If you have a requirements.txt file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If not, install the necessary libraries manually:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

4.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Credit-Risk-Analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1.  Open the `Credit-Risk-Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2.  Follow the instructions and execute the cells in the notebook.
3.  The notebook will guide you through the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
4.  Ensure that the dataset is available in the specified location within the notebook or adjust the file paths accordingly.

## Dataset

(Describe the dataset used. Include information about the source, features, and target variable.)

Example:

The dataset used in this analysis is the [Name of Dataset] dataset, which contains [number] records and [number] features. The target variable is `default`, indicating whether a loan applicant defaulted on their loan. The features include [list a few key features].

## Model

(Describe the model(s) used and the rationale behind their selection.)

Example:

This project utilizes [Name of Model(s)], such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to predict credit risk. These models were chosen for their effectiveness in binary classification tasks and their ability to handle various feature types.

## Results

(Summarize the key findings and performance metrics of the model.)

Example:

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of [percentage]% and an F1-score of [score]. The model effectively identified high-risk applicants, demonstrating its potential for credit risk assessment.
